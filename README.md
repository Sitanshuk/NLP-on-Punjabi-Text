# NLP-on-Punjabi-Text
This project focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Punjabi text data. The objective was to build a language model for the Punjabi language and classify news articles as political or non-political.

## Background
The project involved the following steps:

1. **Vocabulary Building:** We used a Punjabi text dataset to build a comprehensive vocabulary for our own Punjabi language model. This step ensured that our model could effectively understand and process Punjabi text.

2. **Preprocessing:** The Punjabi text dataset underwent preprocessing to clean and standardize the data. This preprocessing step was crucial for creating a generic Punjabi language model that could handle various types of Punjabi text data.

3. **Classification of News Articles:** After preprocessing the dataset, we focused on classifying news articles as political or non-political. We trained a Keras model on a labeled training set to predict whether a given news article belonged to the political category or not. The model achieved an impressive accuracy of approximately 87%.

4. **Visualization:** In order to gain insights into the classification process, we visualized the words in a 3D space. This visualization helped us understand which words contributed more towards classifying the news articles as political or non-political. It provided valuable insights into the important features and patterns within the Punjabi text data.
